# About Me
I'm a software engineer in Bangalore. Prospective Fall '25 MSCS student at Georgia Tech in the systems specialization.

I love learning, lifting and coldbrew. More about me in my RESUME.

## On My Plate
- Retrofitting an observability stack into a years old codebase
- Brushing up everything for college
- JLPT N2 (success chance: 10%)
